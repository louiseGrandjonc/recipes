# Quenelles de maman


## Ingredients

* 1/2L milk
* 150g semolina (semoule fine)
* 100g gruyere rape (shreded swiss cheese)
* 2 eggs
* a little piece of butter (like 15g)
* pepper
* nutmeg


### Note
Salt is not super useful because of the cheese


## How to do it:


1. Heat the milk with the butter in a pot, add the pepper and nutmeg
2. Once the milk is boiling, reduce to low heat, add the semolina and stir until it "detach" itself from the pot
3. Take the pot out of the fire, add 2 eggs, one after the other
4. Add cheese
5. Put some flour on the table, and start forming the quenelles
6. Boil a big pot of water. And have ready a big bowl of water
7. Put the quenelles in the boiling water, when they float, put them in cold water

## Note

You can freeze part of the quenelles #singleLife.
The idea is to use the quenelle in a gratin with some tomato sauce, and a bit of cheese on top of it.
